This repository is a series of Jupyter notebooks that makes great use of the Pandas module
(found [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/)) to import .csv files containing past
storm/fire reports, rainfall, etc and outputs new .csv containing various data described below. It should be noted that parts of
the scripts written here can be written in shorter, more efficient ways, most likely. But, the data that was output was the data
we were needing, so the scripts did the job. This readme is divided into two sections: Information regarding the research 
methods, various weather and climate events, etc. and a section describing a few essential lines of code utilized.

Any questions or concerns can be directed to me at either ty.dickinson@noaa.gov or Ty.Dickinson@ou.edu

### Setting the Stage
At NWS Austin/San Antonio Weather Forecast Office we defined our seasons to be as follows:

Winter: December, January, February

Spring: March, April, May

Summer: June, July, August

Fall: September, October, November

Storm reports (except Fire Weather) were gathered using the National Centers for Environmental Information's (NCEI) 
[Storm Events Database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/).

A report day is defined to be 12Z - 12Z as overnight events are frequent and should be considered together. 

#### *Combining Fatalities and Injuries into a Single Indicator*
To better account for a large number of zeros for fatalities in individual years within a season, injuries and fatalities were 
combined into a single indicator (called adjusted fatalities). After using the scripts to output the raw number of fatalities 
and injuries, there are three (3) possibilities:
1. A recorded fatality (whether there are associated injuries does not matter yet, but will later)
2. No recorded fatalities, but there are injuries
3. No recorded fatalities and injuries

For possibility (1), the associated adjusted fatality is whatever number was recorded. For possibility (2), the associated
adjusted fatality is the number of injuries divided by 100 (or 1000 if there are any instances of injuries > 1000). For 
possibility (3), the associated fatality is 0. This can be done for each year in each season. 

The next step in analysis is to rank all indicators. For adjusted fatalities, rank the adjusted fatalities from 1 to n, where n
is the number of years in the climatology and where 1 is the highest value. For instances of ties, use injuries to attempt to 
break the tie (i.e. in years where the recorded fatality is kept, the number of injuries is used to break the tie). If ties
still exist, break them as one normally would by adding the ranks in question and dividing by the number of years in the tie.
Here is a basic example: 
```
Adjusted Fatalities             Injuries                Rank
2                               10                      1
2                               5                       2
1                               6                       3.5
1                               6                       3.5
1                               0                       5
.06                             6                       6
.05                             5                       7
.04                             4                       8
0                               0                       9.5
0                               0                       9.5
```

## Severe Weather

Selections in NCEI Storm Data: Hail, Lightning, Thunderstorm Wind, Tornado

Climatology: 1981-2010

Indicators: Total number of reports, number of report days, maximum hail size, maximum wind magnitude 
(non tornadic), maximum tornado width, total tornado path length, total rainfall (discussed below), and adjusted fatalities. 



## River/ Flash Flooding

Selections in NCEI Storm Data: Flash Flood, Flood

Climatology: 1981-2010. Storm reports output from NCEI's site are only 1996 and on. To go back to 1981, we went through the NCEI
publications (found [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/IPS/sd/sd.html)) and manually added flash flood and flood reports. In addition,
archived E-5 reports filed by past hydrologists were examined to best include all past events as possible.

Combining river flooding and flash flooding may not always be applicable to every WFO. 

Indicators: Number of flash flood reports, number of days with a report, adjusted fatalities, total
rainfall (discussed below), maximum one day rainfall and two day rainfall (also discussed below), and number of times river 
gages went above moderate flood stage. 

In regards to river gages, 54 were selected on major rivers and creek throughout the CWA. 

The main flooding script will output: reports, report days, fatalities, injuries, and damages. The rainfall data is discussed below
and the number of times river gages went above moderate was gathered by hand through AWIPS.


## Fire Weather

Report dataset was obtained from the Texas Fire Marshal's Office. 

Climatology: 2000-2014

The dataset obtained went back to 1982, however there were no figures for acres burned from 1982-1999. Thus, we decided to
use a 15-year climatology for now.

Indicators: Adjusted fatalities (found using combined fire service and civilian fatalities and combined fire service 
and civilian injuries), acres burned, number of fires, number of days with a fire, total seasonal rainfall, average CWA 
high temperature, and KBDI/number of dry fronts.

In our dataset times were not given for the fire reports, so number of days with a fire were strictly by date.

KBDI was provided by Texas A&M University on a county-by-county basis from 1995 to the present. These files listed each counties'
average, minimum, and maximum KBDI values. For our indicator, we found the number of days each county had an average above 575 or a
maximum above 650. The sum of all 33 counties in our CWA was used. This method only applies to summer and fall. In the winter 
and spring, we used number of dry fronts, as these produce the large-scale winds that favor fire weather. They had to have produced 
less than 0.1 inches of rain, on average, and there were not wetting rains of 0.2 inches in the previous two days. Ideally, we use
solely KBDI in the summer, solely frontal passages in the winter, and weight KBDI and frontal passages half and half in spring
and fall to account for year-to-year variability in date of first and last strong frontal passage. 

Any controlled burning or prescribed burn that did not have a fatality, injury, associated cost, or acres burned listed was
removed.


## Winter Weather 

Seasons may be changed to October, November, December and January, February, March. 

Climatology: 1981-2010. Storm reports output from NCEI's site are only 1996 and on. To go back to 1981, we went through the NCEI
publications (found [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/IPS/sd/sd.html)) and manually added appropriate reports.

For our CWA, all reports were considered as one large season (essentially November through March) since there is not a large 
number of total reports. 

Possible selections in NCEI Storm Data: Blizzard, Cold/Wind Chill, Extreme Cold/Wind Chill, Frost/Freeze, Heavy Snow, 
Lake-Effect Snow, Sleet, Winter Storm, Winter Weather

Possible indicators: Number of total reports (large amount of possibilities in NCEI Storm Database seen above), number of days 
with a report, adjusted fatalities, total snowfall, maximum one and two day snowfall.

Snowfall may not always align with number of reports since (especially for this EWX's CWA) freezing rain/sleet/ice are
common (relatively speaking, for winter weather) and can cause serious impacts.

The large number of possibilites to select in storm data represents the large number of advisories/warnings 
NWS forecasters can issue. For example, if impacts were seen after a Winter Weather Advisory was issued, then in storm
data it would be tagged as Winter Storm; if it was a Winter Storm Warning that was issued then its tag would be Winter Storm.

## Rainfalls

There are multiple rainfall scripts uploaded. 

COOP Rainfall takes daily rainfall accumulations from COOP stations and outputs maximum one day and two day rainfall. 52 COOP 
stations were selected in an attempt to fully cover all counties in the CWA as well as have mutliple in metropolitan areas such 
as Austin and San Antonio. (Named COOP Rainfall Totals)

A script that reads in all .csv files containing local maxima from COOP stations and outputs the global maximum from these values
as well as the station this maximum was recorded at. This script is almost complete. (Named Maximum Rainfall)

LCRA Rainfall is used to estimated total rainfall throughout a given area using quadrangles created by the Lower Colorado River
Authority (LCRA). 
They have collected rainfall data since 1940 and have monthly tables for rainfall and evaporation available at their 
[website](http://www.twdb.texas.gov/surfacewater/conditions/evaporation/).

We selected quadrangles that were over two-thirds covered by area in our county warning area (CWA). Output is rainfall estimations 
for our CWA area. (Named LCRA Rainfall)

Quadrangles used in calculation for our CWA:
- 709
- 710
- 807
- 808
- 809
- 810
- 908

Quadrangles used elsewhere:
- 606
- 607
- 706
- 707
- 708
- 811
- 910
- 1010

Another possible method of estimating total rainfall is through use of climate divisions (CDs). Each state is divided into climate
divisions and total monthly and seasonal rainfall is calculated for each climate division in the National Weather Service's [Local
Climate Analysis Tool (LCAT)](http://nws.weather.gov/lcat/). A fraction of a CWA can be found inside of each CD then multiplied 
by the CD's rainfall and summed for all CDs of interest. 


LCRA vs. CD is a script that I wrote before doing a Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test to determine if there is a statistically significant
difference between gathering rainfall accumulations using LCRA 1 degree latitude by 1 degree longitude quadrangles or by using 
the Climate Divisions.This test was done at the 95% significance level, was a two-tailed test, and used a large sample
approximation.

## Snowfall

COOP Stations also record snowfall and snow depth, which could be useful for winter weather. However, snowfall measurements should 
be  made sure not to be related to severe weather days, as melted hail accumulations is recorded as snowfall.

## Tropical Weather

## Statistics

Statistics were used heavily in data analysis. Because we cannot assume a normal distribution fits our data well, we used
a nonparametric approach. Nonparametric statistics rely on ranking the data, hence why the bottom ten ranks are classified as 
below normal, the middle ten as near normal, and the top ten as above normal. 

To ensure we could use LCRA rainfall over Climate Division rainfall, we used Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests to test if there was
statisically significant differences. 

Each indicator was ranked with 1 being the highest value (lowest value for rainfall for fire weather)
and n being the lowest value (highest value) where n is the number of years in the climatology. These ranks were then summed 
across a single year and then this sum was ranked against all sums in the climatology to obtain a year's overall rank. This overall
rank was 1 for the most impactful year and n for the least impactful year. 

We also used Cronbach's Alpha Tests on the ranks for each indicator to test for internal consistency. 

## Predictors Stuff

We used the Oceanic NiÃ±o Index as a measure of ENSO. These values can be found at the 
[Climate Prediction Center's page on ONI](http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ensoyears.shtml).

CPC Seasonal Outlooks were also utilized, and can be found [here](ftp://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/cpcfcsts/archives/long_lead/data/).
A station's list is available [here](http://old.wetterzentrale.de/klima/stnlst.html). Note that the CPC only uses official
WMO stations. These stations have a station number whose seventh digit is 0 in the station link list. Stations that end in 
something other than a 0 denote that they are near a WMO site and are other sites like ASOS or COOP. The stations used 
for our CWA were San Antonio International Airport, Austin Mueller Municipal Airport, and Del Rio International Airport.

In some cases, indicators in one season were used as a predictor for another. For example, total CWA rainfall in spring 
is used as an indicator for spring but then also used as a predictor for summer when looking at fire weather.

Spearman's Rank-Order Correlations were used to test strength of predictors with the ranks determined in the climatology.

# Some Code Explanations

The Pandas module is a very powerful, yet easy to use, module for data analysis using tabular data. All of the data used in 
this research was either in tabular format directly from a URL or imported in from an existing .csv file. Output is also in .csv
format which can easily be converted to .xlsx for further analysis, such as statistics. Below I will briefly discuss a few 
lines of code I utilized very often. Pandas documentation is also very accessible and helpful through a simple Google search.

## Reading in a .csv file
```
Table = pd.read_csv('C:\Users\Ty Dickinson\Downloads\SevereStormsUpdated.csv', low_memory=False)
Table['BEGIN_DATE'] = pd.to_datetime(Table.BEGIN_DATE)
```

The first line sets the .csv file from the specified path as a variable called Table. By doing this, you can easily call
specific columns of data, like in line 2 where I access the column labeled BEGIN_DATE. 
This second line converts that whole column from the default datatype object to a Pandas datatype called datetime. This is an
amazing function and allows dates to easily be analyzed later. This conversion is very powerful as Pandas can automatically 
recognize the format of the date (and time, if it is in the same column) regardless if it uses slashes or dashes. 

## Separating the Entire Table into Seasons
```
df = Table.set_index(['BEGIN_DATE'])
Date1 = '12-01-1980'
Date2 = '02-28-1981'
Date1 = pd.to_datetime(Date1)
Date2 = pd.to_datetime(Date2)
x = df.loc[Date1:Date2]
```

By default, when tabular data is read into the program, it in indexed from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of rows in the original
file. The first line above sets the index to instead be the BEGIN_DATE column. This allows me to use the .loc function. Dates 1 
and 2 are defined and converted to a datetime format to be used in the .loc. The last line sets the variable x to be the portion
of the file that is between those two dates (both dates are included). 

## Running the Script Through Seasons for Several Years
```
WinterCount = 0
while WinterCount <= 30:
    x = df.loc[Date1:Date2]
    if Date2.is_leap_year:
        Date2 = Date2 - pd.DateOffset(days=1)
    Date1 = Date1 + pd.DateOffset(years=1)
    Date2 = Date2 + pd.DateOffset(years=1)
    if Date2.is_leap_year:
        Date2 = Date2 + pd.DateOffset(days=1)
    WinterCount = WinterCount + 1
```

The While statement is set while WinterCount is less than or equal to 30, for all the winter seasons of interest in our 
time period. 
pd.DateOffset is used in lines 6 and 7 to add one year to Dates 1 and 2 so that the next time the while statement runs, 
the boundaries are Dec. 1981 and Feb. 1982 instead of 1980 and 1981, respectively. 
Pandas has a very helpful function called is_leap_year that looks at the year of a date and will return True or False if the
year is a leap year or is not a leap year. Line 8 says that if Date 2 is a leap year (so, if True was returned) then to 
add 1 day (line9) so that Feb. 29 is not missed. Lines 4 and 5 do the same but after all the calculations are made based on
the data in the file so that adding a year to Date 2 does not return an error (cannot have a Feb. 29 in a non-leap year).

## Creating a Pandas Dataframe and Exporting to a .csv 
```
df1 = pd.DataFrame({'Winter Reports': WinterReports})
df2 = pd.DataFrame({'Spring Reports': SpringReports})
df3 = pd.DataFrame({'Summer Reports': SummerReports})
df4 = pd.DataFrame({'Fall Reports': FallReports})
dftot = pd.concat([df1, df2, df3, df4], axis=1)
dftot.to_csv('Severe Weather Impacts.csv')
```

A Pandas dataframe is a 2-Dimensional data structure. I like to think of them as parts of a spreadsheet. 
The first four lines create dataframes based on lists created earlier in the script (WinterReports, Spring Reports, etc) and
also give them a column header name in quotes ('Winter Reports'). pd.concat concatenates the dataframes together into columns
(axis=1 concatenates them into columns; axis=0 would concatenate them into rows). 
Finally, this large dataframe is then exported to a .csv that can be downloaded and is titled Severe Weather Impacts.csv
